## Meeting \#1 - Initial Meeting
* **Date**: May 17, 2023
* **Time**: 7:30 PM

### 1 - Goals
- [x] To figure out what roles each of us will be doing, and filling out the [initial plan document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pc5WVrcgre8pAvwpoAeO3d9nlYAn165I7ZNwHvZhgVk/edit#heading=h.i3tv2mxf7h7z).
- [x] Creating a 150 word synopsis for the game.
- [x] Describing the core game-play system of the game.
- [x] Outline the classes, unity entities, and assets you plan to use in the development of your core game-play system.
- [x] Answer the question, "why do you want to make this game?".
- [x] Explain your game and the other major systems it is composed of in terms of other games and genres.
- [x] List non-core game-play systems and features.

### 1 - Notes
Essentially, we chose an [initial timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1daxQZKiFalyhVolWCPxCEILbFaG9LCLo/edit#gid=666678670) and our [roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pc5WVrcgre8pAvwpoAeO3d9nlYAn165I7ZNwHvZhgVk/edit#). Things are not 100% set in stone yet, but we at least have a basic plan with a list of prerequisites.

## Meeting \#2 - Status Check
* **Date**: May 28, 2023
* **Time**: 6:00 PM

### 2 - Goals
- [x] See how up to date everyone is with their code.
- [x] See what new additions/changes we need to make.
- [x] Ask and answer questions regarding how the GitHub branching works.
- [x] Possibly give tutorial on how to make branch/create pull request.
- [x] Show everyone how to review code on GitHub.
- [x] Talk about the `in progress` tag for GitHub issues.

### 2 - Notes
We caught up on everyone's code. I think here we need to split up some tasks into smaller tasks so that we can all work concurrently and not have to have a lot of waiting time in between working on things.

Some additional obstacles we are thinking about adding are spider webs, giant animals, etc. We think there may be 2 sprites for each obstacle type. We had some discussions about power-ups, and we think that because of the time constraint, we may only be able to work on one.

Overall, we think if we don't have at least a *very* basic game done by Wednesday, May 31 with only a gameplay scene then we should start worrying. Our progress is a bit slower than we want, but still moving forward.
