* Created log files for each of the members. Hopefully this can help everyone keep track of everything and give themselves notes/what they are currently thinking.
* I renamed the `SampleScene` to `Gameplay` to be more consistent as well as make sure everything will not cause issues in the future.
* Updated the `README.md` so that it has the given template from class.
