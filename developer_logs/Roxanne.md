* Created Initial Sprite Artwork of Player, Mount, and Ground. Player, Mount, and Ground sprites were all inspired through the credited online sources, with personal tweaks and edits made by myself on pixelartmaker.com. Also created initial Google Doc to keep track of art licenses and citations for inspiration.
