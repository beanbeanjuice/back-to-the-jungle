# Fish Pattern Tutorial

Open the `fish_patterns.xlsx` file. You should be able to draw *anywhere* as long as it does not take up the two top left slots.

The very top left slot is reserved for the cell at the **BOTTOM LEFT** of your drawing. The slot to the right of that is reserved for the cell at the **TOP RIGHT** of your drawing. Look at examples if you are confused.

You should notice that one of the colors is red. This is the relative (0,0) coordinate for the fish. This is the first fish that will spawn.

The hex codes must be **EXACT**:
* Black: `#0D0D0D`
* Red: `#FF0000`

There can only be one red square.
