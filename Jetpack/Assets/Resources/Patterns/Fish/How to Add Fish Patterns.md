# Fish Pattern Tutorial

1) Open the [fish_patterns.xlsx](fish_patterns.xlsx) file. You should be able to click the hyperlink to open it.
1) Create a new tab.
1) Position A1 will house the location of the **bottom left** of your pattern.
1) Position B1 will house the location of the **top right** of your pattern.
1) Follow the hex codes below when colouring in.
1) Once you have coloured everything in, choose a (0,0) square. This is the "main" fish that will spawn. There can only be one main fish. Set this fish as the red fish. The (0,0)/red fish will be the relative original fish.
1) Once you have created your pattern, save the Excel file.
1) **Close** the excel file.
1) In Unity, right click on `fish_patterns.xlsx` and click **reimport**.
