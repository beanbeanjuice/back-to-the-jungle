## WHY RUN?

> Gary was taking his normal afternoon walk when he heard a loud screeching. This screeching, however, was not human... He followed the screeching to a lab where he found a dinosaur. Being a wildlife activist, he broke into the lab and stole the dinosaur. While evading the scientists, he went through a time machine leading him into the past! He now has to try to find a way out while evading man-eating plants and large birds that are out to get him.

## SCENES

#### Gameplay
![Gameplay][gameplay-image]

This would be the main gameplay scene. It starts off slow, but becomes more and more hectic as you progress!

#### Start
![Start][start-image]

This is where the game will greet you once you have loaded it up!

#### Settings
![Settings][settings-image]

This is where some of the audio settings will be. If the background music becomes annoying after playing for hours, this is where you would change it!

#### Shop
![Shop][shop-image]

Still a work in progress, but this is what the ability and item shop would look like! We tried to make it **gacha** inspired.

## ABOUT

**Back to the Jungle** was created by a team of *6*. We each had individual roles, although we did end up deviating from those toward the end as more free time was created for the other roles.
